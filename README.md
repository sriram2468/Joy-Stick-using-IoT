**IoT-Based Joystick Control System**
This project implements a real-time wireless control system using a 2-axis analog joystick connected to a microcontroller (e.g., ESP8266/ESP32), which transmits positional data over the internet to control a remote device or interface. It demonstrates how analog inputs can be integrated with IoT platforms to create smart control systems such as robotic arms, remote vehicles, or servos over the internet.

üîë Key Highlights
Input Device: 2-Axis Analog Joystick
Microcontroller: ESP8266 / ESP32
Output: Web Dashboard / Remote Motor / Servo
Connectivity: Wi-Fi, Cloud via Firebase, Blynk, or MQTT
Application: Wireless robotic control, smart surveillance, gamepad input simulation

üõ†Ô∏è Technologies & Components
Arduino IDE
ESP8266 / ESP32
Joystick Module (X and Y axes + switch)
Wi-Fi Communication
Cloud Platform: Blynk / Firebase / ThingsBoard / MQTT
Optional: Servo Motor, LED, or Buzzer at receiving end

‚öôÔ∏è Functional Workflow
Read X and Y analog values from the joystick.
Map values to appropriate output range (e.g., 0‚Äì180 for servo).
Transmit values via Wi-Fi using MQTT/Blynk/Firebase.
Receiving end (ESP32) receives values and controls hardware in real time.
(Optional) Button press on joystick triggers extra functions (e.g., stop, light, sound).
